				<p><strong><abbr title="Interim Joint Matriculation Board Examination">IJMBE</abbr></strong>  is a Federal Government Educational Programme that is motivated, controlled and run by <strong>Amadu Bello University, Zaria</strong>. IJMBE is an advanced level educational programme that qualifies a candidate to secure admission into 200 Level in any Nigeria and Foreign Universities through Direct Entry.</p>
				<p>
					IIJMB was established in 1976 as an alternative to JAMB (now UTME) which was (is) the conventional means of getting the secondary school leavers into the university. The board was quick to identify the incessant problem of qualified admission seekers, not being able to secure admission through the convention paradigm. This problem still continued till today. Statistically, only about 20% of annual qualified admission seekers are able to secure admission into the university of their choice.</p>
				<p>
					IJMB is fully certified by <strong>Nigeria University Commission (NUC)</strong> as an A'level programme that serves as a mode of entry into the university today, statistically as its provides a unique platform for realizing the dream of university education-even in a more efficient way than JAMB because it aids in securing admission into <strong>200 LEVEL</strong> upon completion of the programme. </p>
					<p>Interested IJMB Candidate are expected to select any THREE (3) A/L SUBJECTS (English Compulsory) related to their course of study in the university. Candidates would then be lectured on these subjects for a period of 9month and then write the final examination. On completion of the programme, Candidates can therefore use their IJMB result to secure admission into<strong> 200 level</strong> in any Nigeria university via Direct Entry. Interested Candidate can confirm from Jamb brochure to see IJMB as a direct entry requirement into 200level.
